# Bibliography

This file is the canonical reference list for the algorithmic foundations of the layout engine and the routing pipeline (maintained privately alongside the source), which cite into this list by number, e.g. `[4]` linking to entry [4] below.

Entries marked **empirical** in the per-stage map at the end of this document have no academic basis cited because the implementation is a project-specific contribution or a vendor-compatibility adaptation.

## How to cite

In any technical document under `docs/`, write `[N]` inline (CommonMark shortcut reference link), and add a single line at the bottom of the file:

```markdown
[N]: bibliography.md#ref-N
```

That renders `[N]` as a clickable link to the matching entry below.

## Modelling and visual-design references

> **Scope note.** Entries [14] and [15] are *not* algorithmic foundations of the layout engine or routing pipeline. They are practitioner sources for ArchiMate diagramming conventions, and they ground the LLM-facing guidance in `archimate://reference/archimate-view-patterns` ("ArchiMate Modelling & Aesthetic Best Practices"): the view-*setup* advice an agent applies before routing, not the routing algorithm itself. They are listed here so the project keeps a single canonical reference list.

### [14] Hosiaisluoma: ArchiMate Cookbook (Patterns & Examples)

Hosiaisluoma, E. *ArchiMate® Cookbook: Patterns & Examples.* Aligned to ArchiMate 3.2; continuously updated.

[Cookbook PDF](http://www.hosiaisluoma.fi/ArchiMate-Cookbook.pdf) · [Companion blog](https://www.hosiaisluoma.fi/blog/archimate/)

Free, redistributable. Source of the top-down layer-banding convention (customers/actors → Business → Application → Technology), the swimlane-as-large-container-with-nested-members pattern, the Grouping-element clustering pattern, the conventional layer colour palette, and the viewpoint "80% rule" for element selection. The most directly automatable layout guidance of the two.

### [15] Wierda: Mastering ArchiMate (Edition 3.x)

Wierda, G. *Mastering ArchiMate, Edition 3.x.* R&A. ISBN-13 978-9081984096 (Edition III).

[Book site](https://ea.rna.nl/the-book/)

Paid book (paraphrased only, no extended quotation). Source of the explicit minimize-line-crossings heuristic, grid-and-mutual alignment discipline, whitespace-to-imply-grouping guidance, and the nesting-vs-explicit-connector trade-off (nesting compresses detail but is ambiguous about the implied structural relationship).

## Per-stage citation map

## Provenance summary

**Found in repository (planning artifacts, source comments):** [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [7], [8], [9], [10], [12], [13].

**Standard reference works (canonical for the algorithm named in repository sources, not directly cited there):** [6], [11].

**Practitioner modelling/visual-design sources (ground the LLM-facing view-setup guidance, not the algorithm):** [14], [15].

## Caveats

- **Path simplification is not Douglas-Peucker.** `simplifyFinalPath` does greedy farthest-reachable-point shortcutting through obstacle-aware visibility, not perpendicular-distance polyline simplification. Citing Douglas-Peucker (1973) or Ramer (1972) here would be misleading; the stage is flagged as empirical.
- **Clearance-weighted A* is a deliberate departure from prior art.** Prior-art review found that libavoid does not use an inverse-distance clearance penalty. Present clearance-weighting as a project contribution, not a citation-grounded inheritance.
- **`optimize-group-order` adjacent-swap fallback** is closest in spirit to Eades-Lin-Smyth 1993 ("A fast and effective heuristic for the feedback arc set problem") but the connection is unverified. Listed as empirical pending future verification.
- **Brandes-Köpf [11]** is what ELK Layered uses internally; the project consumes ELK output rather than calling [11] directly. Listed for completeness.
